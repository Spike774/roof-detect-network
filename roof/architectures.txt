	NEURAL NETWORK
*************************
Number of layers:
1. SKlearn based logistic regression with graylevel and RGB patches
2. 1 Conv&Pool, 2 Conv&Pool, 3 Conv&Pool, 3+2 Fully connected with 500 neurons

NEXT:
Increase the amount of non-roof training data: try with different proportions

Other changes:
- Amount of testing: increase the test_percent, see how it is affected
- Use larger filters?
- Make larger patches?
- Try rescaling instead of cutting into patches?


*************************
	 Viola and Jones
*************************
Need to experiment with params
- Also add color features?

NEXT:
1. Separate a couple of images for testing...

PARAMETERS:
1. Increase number of negatives (IN PROGRESS)
2. Increase the angle of rotation --> maybe build separate classifiers where the max direction is always the same?
3. What about the scale factor??? It seems like you're picking up only some roofs. You're ignoring smaller ones?

Questions

----------
Viola and jones
----------
Using a test set with viola and jones: a little tricky... with neural network I had more patches for training and testing??? Maybe
Currently training on all, seeing if it captures

2. More data: either John or the other research team

3. OpenCV 2.0.0 is installed, but when I run Viola and Jones it gives me an error. Also I try to import theano in the 'good' machines and it won't work
