Created .dat files using the:
- Augmented metal and thatch roofs
- The metal roofs are divided between tall, wide and square. There is also a single learner that combines all 3 types of roofs rather than dividing them
- They have different paddings: 0,5,10,15 to find out which padding results in better performance

Non_augmented are the .dat files that are split based on size, but that have no augmentation (no flips, etc)
