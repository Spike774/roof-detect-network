TODO:
2. Try to run it on DICE again



****************************** TESTING PIPELINE ***************************************
1. Check how many of the roofs Viola and Jones has missed
How many false positives -->> We REALLY don't want these!!!
How many false negatives -->> They are okay... 


For each of the known roofs:
- compare with all of the roof coordinates found


- What is the size of a patch
Check how much of roof is contained within patch
- But larger roofs may have a smaller percentage
--> If the roof appears in multiple patches, you add up those percentages!


A. Is it found? --> Viola
B. Does it get properly classified? --> Viola patch creation, or Neural Network




IN PROGRESS:
- Use bigger patches
